# State Management

We use [zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for our state management solution.
Less boilerplate, renders components only on changes, centralized, action-based state management (comparing with context).

Stores should **not** implement business logic, only manage app state.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">Some stores automatically persist their state</Callout>
