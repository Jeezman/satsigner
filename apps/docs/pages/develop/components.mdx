# Components

Components in **satsigner** are prefixed with "SS" so we can quickly distinguish them from other components.

## Anatomy & Best practices

The following table shows the anatomy of a **satsigner** component, from the top of the file to the bottom.

| Block of code        | Description                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Imports              | Imports on the top of the file. We use path alias `@` and imports are automatically sorted using `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort` |
| Prop type            | The type of the props the component will receive                                                                                    |
| Function declaration | Declare the component function and export it as default. Use object destructuring for the props and set default values.             |
| Logic                | Component logic                                                                                                                     |
| Computed styles      | Styles that are conditional, based on props, are computed here                                                                      |
| Tsx                  | Return the tsx                                                                                                                      |
| Base styles          | Keep the base styles on the bottom of the file                                                                                      |

## When to create components

If you are going to write new components, first make sure if a new component is really needed or you can just place the code inside the page.
Can we reuse the component or is it big enough/has enough logic to export to a new file?
